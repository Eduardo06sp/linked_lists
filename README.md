# Linked List

In this small project, I created a linked list. Some of the lessons I learned include:
* Becoming familiar with the basics of **dynamic data structures**
* Recognizing the potential **size constraints** of an array versus a linked list in different programming languages
* Learning about holding **data** and **references to other data** in a single object
